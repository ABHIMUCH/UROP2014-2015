# UROP2014-2015 - UI Update

A Work-In-Progress UI update for the UROP blood sugar alert app thing.


New and improved!

Fixed a bunch of crashes

Fixed orientation screwing up the graph

Fixed wrong data display for first value

Added simple material design

Added shared preferences instead of wading through menus

Instead of GraphView, added MPAndroidChart because it's nicer.


Known issues:

The graph loads correctly the first time, but screws up when it updates.

Refresh button doesn't work.


TODO:

Implement the alert system.

Implement refreshing data through the refresh button.

Implement more robust error checking.

Fix any computation errors.
